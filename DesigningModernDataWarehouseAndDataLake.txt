Modern Data Warehousing and adding a data lake to it

1. Evolving to a modern data warehouse
2. Data lake objectives, challenges, and implemenation options
3. When

Data is much more valuable one it is integrated from multiple systems

denormalized

Data Lake is the perfect landing zone for all of the data
not as defined a schema

Machine Learning, predictive analytics, self service reports and models

What makes a Data Warehouse Modern:
1. coexist with data lake
2. Multiplatform architecture

new approach is to complement Hadoop
Augments existing DW
Additional value to existing DW investment

Grow a DW:
Data modeling Strategies
Partitioning
Clustered columnstore index
InMemory structures
MPP - massivel parallel processing

Amazon Redshift
Azure SQL DW

federated data - logically combined data

Lambda architecture
Organization Data ->BatchETL->DataWarehouse
DataLake will contain raw data -> becomes curated data -> DW



Hybrid architecture

Cloud (Salesforce) -> MPP Data Warehouse -> datamart -> Reporting

OnPrem
    Sales systems       ->  DataMart
    Inventory systems   ->  DataMart



DataLake - repository for large quantities of varying data 

IOT, LOGS, Human Generated Data, traditional operational data (sales inventory)

DataLake is reduced up-front effort
No defined schema - almost like dropping files in a directory

large volume of multi-structured data in its native format

Possibly use the DataLake as a staging area for your Data Warehouse
    transform it into a dimensional model in the DW
    treat the DataLake as an active archive

PolyBase - look this up

Acquire - Analyze - Deliver (to DW)


Data Lake is more of a conceptual idea
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File Storage)
NoSQL
Object Stores (Amazon S3, or Azure Blob Storage)


DW values:
Governance
Reliability
Standardization
Security


Zones in a Data Lake - up to you to organize it
RawData/Staging zone
Transient/TempZone
Analytics Sandbox
Curated Data Zone

Bad Data turns into the DATA SWAMP

Organizing the Data Lake
Plan the structure based on optimal data retrieval
The organization pattern should be self documenting

Challenges of a Data Lake
    Data Virtualization layer to query the multiple data sources and pull that data into play for the user
