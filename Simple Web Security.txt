Assumptions:
Write safer code
Mitigate, not prevent
Like an onion make them cry trying to get in


Man in the Middle
------------------
HSTS - HTTP STRICT TRANSPORT Security
- allows trust on first use
- 301 redirect from http to https
- prevents future non-https requests
- 2nd trip gets a 307, it never left the browser, browser stops it
- less than 4% of traffic uses this
- everything has to be https
- can only be set during a secure request
- TOFU - trust on first use
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age: 31536000; includeSubdomains; preload (1 year)
- httppreload.org


CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery
Ways to Mitigate:
 - disable CORS

CONTENT SECURITY POLICY:
------------------------
Allows you to declare your content resources

Header determines where your site can pull content from


UPCERTS
------------------------
Burp Suite - interceptor


Use Hashes for validating ID or other values

AUTHENTICATION
-------------------------
make sure that the authentication process follows the same flow
looking for same period of time to handle the request
Length of response should be similar
Response time should be similar


Rainbow Table - value hashed under diff algorithms
