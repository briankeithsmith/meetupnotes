React Meetup

Intro to Redux
-------------------------------
this.setState  is an action creator
dispatches an action against the state

state goes DOWN the component hierarchy
it also passes state handlers down
one-way data binding


What does the component tree for your app look like?

Without redux you need a common parent for state - or for portions of your state needed by other components


3 Principles of Redux:
1. Single store for state
2. Don't mutate state
3. dispatch actions to trigger state updates - pure reducers


Provider from react-redux
createStore from redux
colorReducer from ./reducers/colorReducer

const store = createStore(colorReducer);


create Action Handlers
example would be colorActions.js


Reducers handle state
example would be colorReducer.js

const colorReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
	

}


import { connect } from 'react-redux';


can connect "(using connect)" to any component along the way, up or down (I think?)

Connected - Smart  - Container
Disconnected - Dumb - Presentational


Learn React First, then Redux




Mark Pedrotti
Uneject and Recreate-react-app
---------------------------------------
github.com/pedrottimark

eject - means ejecting the default configuration

Current Situation:
Painful Problem
Why it is a problem

Desired situation:

install create-react-app as global

it installs the current version of react-scripts
npm install react-test-renderer


place tests in __tests__ file
npm test will run those test items

Allows an End to End test using Snapshot of rendered react component


Commit tests and snapshots so that others can compare against them




PMing in React
product management in react

PM between UX, Tech, Business

Product Mgr is not a project mgr


What do you wish your PM knew about React dev?
good stuff takes time
are timeframes realistic
PM should be good at defense - saying no, blocking client
need more budget

different team dynamics
