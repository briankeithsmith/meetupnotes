Angular Goodness 12/12

=====================================

Balsamiq for mockups

Craigslist sample app

ng new bogus-job
    - components and services
    - npm modules

app.module.ts - bootstraps the app
    - all of the injections
    - brings in all you need
    - supporting services

ng g c componentnamehere
    -   html
    -   spec.ts
    -   component.ts
    -   component.css


ng serve to serve the app
    -- ng serve --open
    -- get the default app on a port

if you use ng create to add a service, it doesn't automatically add it to app.component.ts

Route Guards - prevents someone from leaving the page without saving first
    - also prevents getting to an invalid route (job id doesn't exist for instance)



on a route in app.module.ts
    path:, component:, canActivate: [activateservicehere]
