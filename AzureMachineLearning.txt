Why Azure Machine Learning
==========================

Common Data Science Struggles
 - data not in right format
 - no access to data
 - must know statistics (perceived)

 - Steep learning curve/code heavy
 - testing and optimization can be time consuming
 - requires 3rd party tools and heaving coding skills to productionalize


 What is Azure Machine Learning
  - cloud
  - well documented algorithms
  - code free GUI
  - early integrates into Enterprise Data Structure


FREE version
    - predictive web services
    - R & Python
    - you can import your own packages

    - clean mising data functionality is built in
        - custom substitution
        - mean/median/mode
    - in the Machine Learning category
        - Initialize Model
            - Anomoly Detection
            - Classification - classify our values - in our case 2-class
