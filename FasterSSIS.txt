FASTER SSIS
Andy Leonard

How can we accomplish this?
Build Data integration FASTER
make data integration more manageable


SSIS ludicrous speed

BLOBs in SQL 2016 can be up to 2GB

DT_NTEXT (BLOB)
BLOBTempStoragePath - the path you use for processing those
e:\BLOBTemp - separate path from OS, and other processing

You can override the parameters in an SSIS package from the command line in most cases.

BufferTempStoragePath - when you have to swap BufferTempStoragePath

By using those 2 parameters you scan potentially speed SSIS by 40%

SSIS as a service coming to Azure

CDC - change detection

CRC - cyclical redundancy check - hashing check - CHECKSUM

System.Encryption - .net
They moved portion of this into SQL known as HashBytes

HashBytes('SHA1', convert(varchar,fieldname)+'|'|convert(varchar,nextfield))
//usage - only picks up new and changed rows
Where d.HashValue is null or
HashBytes <> d.HashValue

MERGE doesn't scale

Could use this with CFP

LinkServers are self-abuse

You can use Postgres and MySQL in Azure now
